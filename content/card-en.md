# Card

## Description

A card is a content‑first container that groups one item or piece of information into a compact, self‑contained unit to support quick scanning and comparison. It usually combines a title, brief text, optional imagery, metadata, and clear actions, and is best used in collections such as grids, lists, or feeds where people choose which items to explore in more detail.

## Definition and Purpose

A card is a content container that brings together a small, coherent piece of information and presents it as a single unit. Each card represents one object, item, or piece of content, such as a product, article, project, or person. The pattern helps people quickly understand what the item is, why it might matter to them, and what they can do next.

Cards support scanning, comparison, and decision‑making. Instead of forcing people to open detailed views for every item, a card offers a compact preview: a title, a short explanation or key facts, optional imagery, and one or more clear next steps. When multiple cards are shown together, the interface effectively becomes a collection of small summaries that invite people to explore further.

The purpose of a card is not only to display content, but to help people choose. Good cards are focused: they surface the most relevant information needed to decide whether to ignore the item, pay more attention to it, or act on it.

## Usage Context

Cards are used when people need an overview of several similar items and must make quick comparisons or choices. Typical examples are product grids, article overviews, project galleries, dashboards that list objects, and feeds that mix several kinds of content. In these situations, the card acts as the smallest meaningful unit in the layout.

The pattern works especially well when many cards appear side by side in a grid or stacked vertically in a list. The repeated structure helps people learn how to read one card and then apply that understanding to all other cards. Consistent visual hierarchy and content order are important so that users can quickly locate the title, key facts, and available actions on every card.

Cards are less suitable when there is only a single object on a page, when the content is dense and requires detailed reading, or when the main goal is to complete a single, focused action. In those cases, a simple content block, a full detail view, or a dedicated form or button is usually a better choice than a card.

## Structure

Although cards can vary in appearance, they typically share a small set of content elements arranged in a predictable hierarchy. Not every card needs all of these parts, but the combination should still form a complete, understandable unit.

- Header: A clear title or name that identifies what the card is about.
- Visual element: Optional image, thumbnail, icon, or avatar that supports quick recognition or adds context.
- Main content: Short text or key facts that explain what the item is and why it might be relevant.
- Metadata: Secondary information such as status, category, date, owner, or location that helps refine decisions.
- Actions: One or more entry points, such as a primary button or link to open details, plus optional secondary actions.

The layout of these elements should follow a clear hierarchy. The most important information belongs near the top or in a visually emphasized position, while supporting details can appear below or in a more subdued style. Actions should be discoverable without overwhelming the content; a card that tries to expose too many choices at once easily becomes noisy and hard to scan.

## Relation to Other Patterns

Cards sit between simple navigation elements and full detail views. They are more content‑rich than tiles or basic buttons, but less exhaustive than full pages or complex object views. This middle position is what makes cards useful for overview and comparison.

It is common to confuse cards with tiles. A tile or navigation tile primarily exists to take people somewhere or trigger something. It may show an icon and label, but it usually does not contain a meaningful preview of underlying content. A card, in contrast, is content‑first: even without interacting with it, people should learn something about the item it represents.

Cards are also related to list items and table rows. In a list or table, information is broken into columns or text lines that emphasize alignment and density. Cards trade some of that density for flexibility and visual grouping. They are more suitable when each item needs its own mini‑layout, when imagery plays an important role, or when the emphasis is on understanding each item rather than scanning a large dataset.

Choosing between these patterns is mostly a question of what people need to do. If the main task is to compare many items by one or two attributes, a table or list often works better. If the main task is to understand a smaller set of items in more depth, discover new content, or explore visually rich objects, cards are usually the better pattern.
