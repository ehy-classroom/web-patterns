# Tiles

## What are Tiles?

Tiles are small, repeatable content units that frame related information in a consistent way. They shine when you need a grid of comparable items: cards, teasers, feature highlights, or dashboard widgets that share a structure. A typical tile combines a visual (image or icon), a short title, optional meta, and a brief body. Keep the hierarchy shallow so scanning stays fast. Align tiles to a shared grid; in masonry layouts you can let heights vary while keeping consistent gaps, whereas in regular grids it helps to constrain height for uniform rows. Make the layout responsive by using fluid widths and letting tiles wrap; adjust column counts at breakpoints to keep line lengths readable and whitespace balanced.

Content discipline is key: concise titles, limited body text, and a single primary action per tile keep things clear. Don’t overload tiles with dense copy or multiple CTAs. For accessibility, ensure focus states are visible, tap targets are comfortable, and images have meaningful `alt` text (or `alt=""` if decorative).

## Variants to explore

There are several variants worth exploring. Tile 100 uses minimal visual emphasis with just an image and caption. Tile 200 adds a title and short body. You can also introduce interactive tiles that respond to hover or focus, and decide whether they click through or offer in-place actions.

## When to use tiles

Tiles are a good choice when you present multiple related options or items of similar weight, highlight a set of articles, products, or features for comparison at a glance, or build dashboards where cards summarize key metrics or actions.

## When not to use tiles

Tiles are not ideal for long-form content or complex workflows; reserve those for dedicated pages or panels. For dense data, tables or lists with proper headers and sorting often serve better than tile grids.
