# Tile

## Description

A tile is an interactive entry point. It represents a category, function, or navigation target and takes the user to a new area, an action, or a detail page. The content is kept minimal, often just an image or icon with a short label. Tiles are not meant to present information; they exist to enable selection.

## UX Context

Tiles are used when the user needs to decide or navigate. Common use cases are overview pages, dashboards, tile menus, or portfolio grids where each item is its own navigation point. The emphasis is on orientation and quick scanning of choices.

## Differentiation

Tiles are action‑first. They do not show content previews and contain no internal hierarchy. If an element presents information or context, it is no longer a tile but a card.
